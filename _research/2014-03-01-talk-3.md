title: "An Inexact Fenchel Dual Gradient Algorithm for Distributed Optimization"
excerpt: "â€” In this paper, we design a distributed algorithm for addressing constrained convex optimization over networks. The proposed algorithm is developed by substituting a projected gradient operation for a convex minimization step at each iteration of the Fenchel dual gradient (FDG) method, so that the high computational load of FDG can be significantly alleviated. Such an algorithm can be viewed as a weighted inexact gradient method applied to the Fenchel dual problem, and therefore is referred to as Inexact Fenchel Dual Gradient (IFDG) algorithm."
