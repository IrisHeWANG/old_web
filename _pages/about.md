Hello and wellcome! I am currently a final-year master advised by Prof. [Jie Lu](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2020/0814/c7582a54862/page.htm) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) and [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), majoring in Communication and Information System. Earlier, I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science from ShanghaiTech University as *Outstanding Graduate*. During my undergraduate period, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) for the summer session in 2017.

My research interests lie in **distributed optimization**, **distributed** and **federated machine learning**, **multi-agent reinforcement learning** and **algorithmic game theory**.

**I am actively looking for a *Ph.D. position* starting from Fall 2022.** If you are interested in working with me, feel free to [contact me](mailto:wanghe@shanghaitech.edu.cn)!
