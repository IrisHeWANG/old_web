Hello and welcome! I am currently a final-year master advised by Prof. [Jie Lu](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2020/0814/c7582a54862/page.htm) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), majoring in Information and Communication Engineering. Earlier, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from ShanghaiTech University as an *Outstanding Graduate*. During my undergraduate period, I studied as a visiting undergraduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) for the summer session in 2017.

My research interests lie in the area of networked dynamic systems, with the focus on **distributed/decentralized optimization** and **multi-agent decision-making**.

**Update:** I will join CMU ECE as a PhD student, starting from Fall 2022. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to [contact me](mailto:wanghe@cmu.edu.cn)!
